# CryptoTracker

This project was built with ReactJS (using 'create-react-app') & Reactstrap. The objective was to list the top ten cryptocurrencies based on market-cap, and show their current value, price, and 24-hour change. Also, I added a news feed under the table data, that shows the most recent articles in the cryptocurrency space. This project utilized the [CryptoCompare API](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/).

# Future Improvements

- [] Reduce amount of calls to 'render()' methods
- [] Use Google Firebase as a backend to save user info & auth
- [] Add a Favorites tab that allows the user to save specific cryptocurrencies to view.
- [] Host on Heroku, DigitalOcean, or Netlify
